# Detecting-Phishing-websites

Detecting Phishing website using data mining techniques 

Phishing website dataset is taken from UCI machine learning repository. The dataset was collected by analyzing a collection of 2456 websites among which some were used for phishing and others not. For each website included in the dataset, 30 attributes are given. These features are defined by W3C.Each website features in the dataset is labeled by -1 if it is not a phishing website and by 1 if it is a website used for phishing and 0 if suspicious.(website features are descirebed in .doc file)

Techniques: 

We are going to use following algorithms to classify the websites. 
1) Decision tree algorithm
2) Naïve Bayesian Algorithm 

Steps of the project: 

1) Collect dataset containing malicious and legitimate websites.
2) Writing code to divide the dataset into training and testing sets and code for displaying the evaluation results.
3) Run both the classification algorithms on the dataset.
4) Compare the results for the two models generated using two algorithms and specify which is better.
5) We will computed the precision,  recall, F-score and support for.
6) Finally compute TP( true positive) : Phishing website successfully predicted by decision tree classifier. TN( true negative): Legitimate website successfully predicted by Decision tree classifier, FP (False positive) and FN (False Negative) in Confusion Metrix.




Porpose:

Phishing attack is used to steal confidential information of a user. Fraud websites appears like genuine websites with the logo and graphics of genuine website. This project aims to detect fraud or phishing website using data mining techniques. W3C standard defines characteristics which can be used to distinguish a legal and fraud website. These characteristics can be used for classification. By using data mining techniques, we will generate a classification model which is used to manage and model data. This helps to make a prediction whether the website is legal or fraud.
